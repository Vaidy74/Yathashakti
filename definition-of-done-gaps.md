# Definition of Done - Gap Analysis

## Identified Gaps

| Area | Gap | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|-----|----------|---------------|
| **Testing** | Most completed items lack explicit unit test coverage metrics | High | Add TI-04: Increase test coverage to 80% across all modules |
| **Documentation** | API endpoints lack comprehensive documentation | Medium | Add CA-04: Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI |
| **Accessibility** | UI components haven't been verified for accessibility standards | High | Add UI-04: Perform accessibility audit and remediation |
| **Cross-browser** | No explicit cross-browser testing has been performed | Medium | Add TI-05: Implement cross-browser testing with BrowserStack |
| **Security** | Security features implemented but no formal security scan | High | Add TS-05: Perform security audit and vulnerability assessment |
| **Performance** | No performance benchmarks or load testing | Medium | Add PO-04: Establish performance benchmarks and testing |
