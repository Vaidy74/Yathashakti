## Implementation Notes

Each of these test cases should be implemented as automated tests using a combination of:

1. **Unit Tests** - For testing individual components
2. **API Tests** - For testing backend endpoints
3. **End-to-End Tests** - For testing complete user journeys using tools like Cypress or Playwright

For E2E tests, consider implementing these using a framework like Cypress or Playwright, which can simulate user interactions and verify the state of the application after each action.

Example Cypress test structure for recording a repayment:

```javascript
describe('Record Repayment Journey', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Login and setup test data
    cy.login('test@example.com', 'password');
    cy.createTestGrant();
  });

  it('should successfully record a repayment', () => {
    // Navigate to grant detail
    cy.visit('/grants/[test-grant-id]');
    
    // Click record repayment button
    cy.contains('Record Repayment').click();
    
    // Fill out form
    cy.get('#amount').type('1000');
    cy.get('#method').select('BANK_TRANSFER');
    cy.get('#paymentDate').type('2025-05-15');
    cy.get('#notes').type('Test repayment');
    
    // Submit form
    cy.contains('button', 'Record Payment').click();
    
    // Verify success and redirection
    cy.contains('Payment recorded successfully');
    cy.url().should('include', '/grants/[test-grant-id]');
    
    // Verify repayment appears in history
    cy.contains('Repayment').click();
    cy.contains('tr', 'â‚¹1,000').should('exist');
  });
});
```

These test journeys serve as a foundation for building a comprehensive test suite that can be expanded as new features are added.
